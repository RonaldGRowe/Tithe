Tithes Keeper
=============

![Application Example Picture](https://github.com/RonaldGRowe/Tithe/blob/master/Image/tithe-image.png)

Small C# Windows form used to track individual tithe contributions.

Windows Access database was used to store the information.
A text file was also created to be used for a backup or verification.
The user was able to enter the date, name, and account #.
Along with their chosen tithe designations.

This was never implemented, as the church was unable to provide 
enough Windows-capable devices for the congregation to utilize.
However, it would have saved the accounting team numerous hours.
Hand entry is not as accurate or efficient.

The hardest part of the code was getting the database statements
to work with variable names, the syntax was hard to find.

IT was my first successful program that could be utilized by the public.
It was a great feeling and pushed me further.

That being said as I look over the code now I see numerous missteps.

-No Comments!?! what was I thinking

-Redundant code, checking all those inputs like that yikes!

-Variable names could have been better.

-Overall readability is not great.

But I'm still proud of it.
